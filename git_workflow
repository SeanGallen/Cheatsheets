Model

Every commit is immutable. It never changes.

You're only ever adding. Never deleting.
So how do I delete? Add a deletion.
When you change the past, you're fucking everyone who has the present.
Your repository is an aggregation of all your commits... all your additions and deletions.
A branch is a named commit.

Make sure you add a commit -m to any changes


Cardinal Rules

* Commit constantly
* run git status after everything you do.

Practice this

Make a waypoint in front of you, then you can practice

git init - creates a commit.
git status - gs - runs git status
git add - ga - git add a file.

git commit -m "Add a clear short message."

git log  shows the log of the git (gh -l condense version.)

git diff - gd - shows the differences

man git = git manual
